# SliceOfLifeBlog

## Overview
For some, blogging has become an essential tool for individuals and organizations to express their thoughts, opinions and knowledge with the world. 
This is a way to express themselves creatively. I have been blogging since Xanga and Tumblr days, so I have always found comfort in expressing myself through some sort of
creative writing as an art. I (somewhat) started blogging my journey in tech on Hashnode('https://unicorndev.hashnode.dev/'), including a couple of posts regarding productivity
and self-development. One day I thought, well, I'm a developer and I love to build things, so why not make my own blog platform? And here we are.

This blog post app will be built with React, Java and MySQL. React will be used for the front-end portion while Java will be utilized for CRUD operations. 
We will also develop a REST API using Java Spring to bring forth blog post data to the front end.

## Features
- Authentication: Users can sign up, log in/log out
- Authorization: Only authenticated users can create, edit and delete their own posts
- Filter: Blog posts can be filtered based on topic
- CRUD operations
